This is meant to be a (very) barebones starter for Electron projects with React. It provides a solid base for prototyping and leaves things like routing, state management, unit testing, and building for production to be determined for the individual project.

For more full featured boilerplates see the [Electron React Boilerplate](https://github.com/chentsulin/electron-react-boilerplate) or [Electron React Redux Boilerplate](https://github.com/jschr/electron-react-redux-boilerplate).
